# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Applied readable typography, set line-height, and adjusted h1/h2 sizes.
- Implemented layout constraints (max-width + centered content), main padding, and vertical spacing for sections using both margin and padding.
- Styled header/footer, converted the navigation list to a horizontal navigation (removed bullets and underlines), and made images responsive.

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- element selector: body, p, h1, h2
- group selector: header, footer
- descendant selector: nav a
- class selector: .project-card
- ID selector: #main / #contact
- pseudo-class: nav a:hover / a:focus

## One thing I struggled with
- Choosing a compact yet readable type scale that works well on both mobile and desktop without loading external web fonts.

## One improvement I want to do next
- Add a lightweight CSS variables palette and responsive typography breakpoints to improve maintainability and mobile scaling.
